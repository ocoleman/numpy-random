#### An investigation into the numpy.random package.
***
This repository contains a README, a gitignore file and a Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains an analysis of the numpy.random package, including a brief explanation of the use of the package and explanations of some of the more basic functions contained in the package. The notebook also examines several of NumPy's distribution functions, which are used to return different types of randomly generated data.

#### How to run the Jupyter notebook
***
Jupyter Notebook comes pre-packaged with Anaconda which can be gotten <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Alternatively, you can install it manually following the install guide on the Project Jupyter website <a href="https://jupyter.org/install.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
After cloning the repository, open a command terminal and navigate to the location of the <b>numpy-random.ipynb</b> file. Once there, simply type "jupyter notebook" on the command line and hit enter. A local server should launch, and a browser window will take you to the notebook dashboard. From there you should see the numpy-random notebook, if your browser does not open immediately the console should provide you with a link that you can paste in the URL bar of your browser.
